# These are here because HomeKit does a weird thing. It sends an "on"
# command, and then an "off" command when you activate a scene. I'm not
# sure why it does that, but these scripts allow me to turn on scenes and
# ignore the off command. (See scripts.yaml)
#


# Don't start up by default. There's an automation that will start up
# HomeKit once all of the Z-Wave devices have come online.
