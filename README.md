# Bunny's Home Automation Config

This is my config for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io)! Most of the work I have is in my scenes.

I was a big HomeKit user for a while, but I think I've just outgrown what HomeKit can do, so I'm branching out into other things!

## Hardware Used

* [Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TC2BK1X/)
* [Philips Hue](https://www.philips-hue.com) (I have a bunch of this stuff!)
* [Aeotec Z-Stick Gen5 Z-Wave Hub](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00X0AWA6E/)
* A crazy number of Hue Blubs
* Some Z-Wave hardware, which is just odds-n-ends stuff
