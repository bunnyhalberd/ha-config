# What are these?

These scenes are created via a dump of the state of my Hue bridge, and then cleaned up to remove things I don't want in each scene.

I'm a visual person. To create a scene I walk around the house with my phone, and set up things in the Hue app the way I want. When I'm done, I come back to my laptop, dump the state of the bridge into a file, and clean it up to make a scene.

I largely don't touch these by paw, they're mostly generated for a specific visual look that I am after.
